# Workflow for the Encoding and Publication of EHRI Online Editions  

## Presentation of the Project
The [European Holocaust Research Infrastructure](https://www.ehri-project.eu/) (EHRI) is a transnational organisation with partners all across Europe, Israel and the US. They promote collaboration on Holocaust research and easy access to scattered sources about the Holocaust. To this end, they created the [EHRI Online Editions](https://www.ehri-project.eu/ehri-online-editions), which are collections of archival documents on the Holocaust, gathered around a specific theme like testimonies on the persecution of the Jewish population or accounts on the deportations to Nisko (Poland) in 1939.
